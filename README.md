# WordWarden-Toxicity-Classifer

Word Warden, an innovative natural language processing (NLP) project designed to mitigate the spread of toxic language in online interactions. The goal of this project will be to use machine learning to identify toxicity in text, which could be used to help deter users from posting potentially hurtful messages, craft more civil arguments when engaging in discourse with others, and to gauge the toxicity of other users' comments.

This project aims to implement various machine learning models – specifically Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, KNN Classification, Naïve Bayes Classification & Random Forest methods to tackle the above task, assessing these models' performances on both binary and multi-label classification tasks. Notably, this project has harnessed the power of the Naive Bayes method to achieve the highest accuracy in the classification of textual data, underscoring the efficacy of this particular approach in the context of identifying and moderating toxic content.
